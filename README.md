# Feed Reader

This is a feed reader that has tests built in Jasmine to ensure things work properly. Opening the page will let Jasmine run and if the intended tests are all passed, then everything should come up green.

## Run instructions
Simply right-click on the index.html file and open it in the browser of your choice. From there, you can also test using the dev tools (which can be opened in your browser's settings). As of now, all of the tests pass, so if any changes are made to this reader, then they should remain passing!

## Resources used:
I used a Udacity forum post to guide me in the last part! It took a while, but I finally understand how the code works and made a version of my own.
